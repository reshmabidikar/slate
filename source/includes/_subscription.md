# Subscription

A `Subscription` in Kill Bill entitles a customer to the use of a product or service for a period of time in exchange for a specified payment. Every subscription belongs to a `Bundle` that is associated with a given customer `Account`.

Subscriptions are created by specifying a `Plan` from the catalog, and an effective date on which to start. The Plan identifies the `Product` subscribed along with the terms of service and of billing. These attributes are used by the system to drive the generation of invoices. Kill Bill offers two parallel views of the subscription: one to track the entitlement, i.e the service associated with the subscription, and one to track the billing. These views address the following questions:

* Given a date, how much should we invoice ?
* Given a date, is the service available to the customer? 

For most use cases, those two views are one and the same; the customer gets invoiced for what she consumes.

Please refer to our [subscription manual](http://docs.killbill.io/latest/userguide_subscription.html) for more details.

| **auditlogs**                | array  | system         | Array of audit log records for this invoice                                                           |

**productCategory**: possible values are BASE, ADD_ON, or STANDALONE

**billingPeriod**: possible values are DAILY, WEEKLY, BIWEEKLY, THIRTY_DAYS, THIRTY_ONE_DAYS, SIXTY_DAYS, NINETY_DAYS, MONTHLY, BIMESTRIAL (bimonthly), QUARTERLY, TRIANNUAL, BIANNUAL, ANNUAL, SESQUIENNIAL, BIENNIAL, TRIENNIAL, or NO_BILLING_PERIOD

**phaseType**: possible values are: TRIAL, DISCOUNT, FIXEDTERM, or EVERGREEN

**state**: possible values are:

* `PENDING`: The subscription is not yet created.
* `ACTIVE`: The subscription is currently active.
* `BLOCKED`: The subscription is currently paused.
* `CANCELLED`: The subscription has been cancelled.
* `EXPIRED`: The subscription has expired. This state is applicable only for subscriptions with a `FIXEDTERM` phase.

**sourceType**: possible values are NATIVE, MIGRATED, or TRANSFERRED 


**chargedThroughDate**: The date up to which the entitlement for this subscription has been invoiced. For `IN_ADVANCE` billing mode, this date will often be in the future; for `IN_ARREAR`, this date will often be in the past. For example,

1. A subscription is billed each month, on the 15th, in advance. If we check on May 31, the `chargedThroughDate` will be June 15th, 15 days ahead. If the subscription is ended on May 31, a prorated credit will need to be issued.

2. A subscription is billed quarterly, in arrears, on the 10th of Feb., May, Aug., and Nov. If we check on Jul. 20, the `chargedThroughDate` will be May 10, over 2 months earlier. If the subscription is cancelled on Jul. 20, an additional invoice will need to be issued.

These use cases assume that invoicing is up to date. If AUTO_INVOICING_OFF is set, invoicing relies on a manual process and may be late. In that situation the first use case may require a smaller credit or none at all, while the second case will have a larger amount to be billed to close out the subscription.

**billCycleDayLocal**: this value is either the overridden subscription billCycleDay (in case of BCD change) or the value at the subscription, bundle or account level (depending on the catalog [billing alignments](http://docs.killbill.io/latest/userguide_subscription.html#_billing_alignment_rules)). For `ACCOUNT` billing alignments, if the account level billCycleDay hasn't been set yet, the value returned would be null.


**priceOverrides**:  List of overridden prices for specific plan phases. Can be specified to override the fixed/recurring price in the catalog for a particular phase. For example, suppose you are creating a subscription corresponding to a plan that has an `EVERGREEN` phase with a recurring price of `$100`. You can specify an overridden price of `200` while creating the subscription by specifying a `priceOverrides` object as follows:


`
"priceOverrides": [
        {
            "planName": "shotgun-monthly",
            "phaseType": "DISCOUNT",
            "fixedPrice": null,
            "recurringPrice": 150.00,
            "usagePrices": []
        }
`

**quantity**: An integer value that specifies the quantity of subscription. The default value is 1. The corresponding invoice is generated as per the quantity. So if `price=$20/mo`, `quantity=$2` => `invoiceItem recurring amount=$40`.

## SubscriptionEvent Resource

The SubscriptionEvent resource represents an event on a subscription. An event is generated when a subscription is created, cancelled, paused, resumed,etc. In addition, events are also generated when there is a phase change or plan change.  

| Name                     | Type     | Generated by | Description                                                           |

| **serviceStateName**     | string   | user         | Name of the event state                                               |
                                                      |

## Subscriptions

These endpoints support the basic CRUD operations on Subscriptions.

### Create a subscription

This API creates a base product subscription. It also creates a bundle to contain the subscription. See [Bundle](bundle.html) for further information.

**Request Body**

A subscription resource object specifying `accountId` and either the `planName` or a combination of `productName`, `productCategory`,`billingPeriod` and `priceList`. 

It can also include the following optional fields:

* `phaseType` - Target phase type. Specifying this field causes the subscription to start with this phase.
* `externalKey` - External key corresponding to the subscription.
* `billCycleDayLocal` - Per-subscription BCD. Specifying this value allows realigning the billing with the specified date. 
* `bundleId` - Id of the bundle in which to create this subscription. Can be specified only while invoking this method for an addon subscription.

Creating a subscription often triggers the creation of an invoice, and associated with this there is often a payment (against the invoice). If **callCompletion** is true, the call to this API will be delayed until the invoice is created and/or the payment is processed. However, the maximum delay in seconds will be given by **callTimeoutSec**.

**Other Notes:**

* Specifying the `startDate`/`billingStartDate` as part of the request body has no effect, these dates need to be passed as query parameters (`entitlementDate`/`billingDate`). 
* The `entitlementDate` drives the subscription state. So, if a subscription is created with a future `entitlementDate`, its state remains `PENDING` until the date is reached after which it becomes `ACTIVE`.
* When a `DateTime` is specified corresponding to the `entitlementDate`/`billingDate` parameters, it may or may not include a timezone component. If a timezone is included (like `entitlementDate=2024-03-10T11:00:00-08:00`), the specified timezone (`PST` in this case) is used. If timezone is not included (like `entitlementDate=2024-03-07T11:15`), it defaults to UTC.



**Response**

If successful, returns a status code of 201 and an empty body. In addition, a `Location` header is returned which contains the new subscription id.

### Create a subscription with addon products

This API creates a subscription bundle with base and addon product subscriptions. It can also be used to add an addon subscription to a base subscription in which case the bundle id of the base subscription must be specified.

**Request Body**

A subscription resource object corresponding to the base subscription and zero or more subscription resource objects corresponding to add-on subscriptions need to be specified. Alternatively, only a list of add-on subscription resource objects may be specified along with the base subscription bundle id. Each subscription resource object needs to include `accountId` and either the `planName` or a combination of `productName`, `productCategory`,`billingPeriod` and `priceList`.

In addition, each subscription resource can also include the following optional fields:

* `phaseType` - Target phase type. Specifying this field causes the subscription to start with this phase.
* `externalKey` - External key corresponding to the subscription.
* `billCycleDayLocal` - Per-subscription BCD. Specifying this value allows realigning the billing with the specified date. 
* `bundleId` - Id of the bundle in which to create this subscription. Can be specified only with an add-on subscription resource.

**Query Parameters**

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| ---- | ---- | -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| **entitlementDate** | string | no | immediately | Date at which the entitlement (sevice) starts in `yyyy-mm-dd` format. If specified, applies both to base and add-on products. |
| **billingDate** | string | no | immediately | Date at which the billing starts in `yyyy-mm-dd` format. If specified, applies both to base and add-on products. |
| **renameKeyIfExistsAndUnused** | boolean | no | true | If true, rename external key if it exists and is unused |
| **migrated** | boolean | no | false | If true, subscription is migrated |
| **skipResponse**               | boolean | no | false | TODO    
| **callCompletion** | boolean | no | false | see below |
| **callTimeoutSec** | long | no | unlimited? | Timeout in seconds (see below) |
| **pluginProperty** | array of strings | false | omit |list of plugin properties, if any |

Creating a subscription often triggers the creation of an invoice, and associated with this there is often a payment (against the invoice). If **callCompletion** is true, the call to this API will be delayed until the invoice is created and/or the payment is processed. However, the maximum delay in seconds will be given by **callTimeoutSec**.

**Response**

If successful, returns a status code of 201 and an empty body. In addition, a `Location` header is returned which contains the new bundle id.

````

**Request Body**

One or more subscription resource object corresponding to the base subscriptions need to be specified. Additional, each base subscription resource object can include zero or more subscription resource objects corresponding to add-on subscriptions. Alternatively, only a list of add-on subscription resource objects may be specified along with the base subscription bundle id. Each subscription resource object needs to include `accountId` and either the `planName` or a combination of `productName`, `productCategory`,`billingPeriod` and `priceList`.


In addition, each subscription resource can also include the following optional fields:

* `phaseType` - Target phase type. Specifying this field causes the subscription to start with this phase.
* `externalKey` - External key corresponding to the subscription.
* `billCycleDayLocal` - Per-subscription BCD. Specifying this value allows realigning the billing with the specified date. 
* `bundleId` - Id of the bundle in which to create this subscription. Can be specified only with an add-on subscription resource.


**Query Parameters**

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| ---- | ---- | -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| **entitlementDate** | string | no | immediately | Date at which the entitlement (sevice) starts in `yyyy-mm-dd` format. If specified, applies both to base and add-on products. |
| **billingDate** | string | no | immediately | Date at which the billing starts in `yyyy-mm-dd` format. If specified, applies both to base and add-on products. |
| **renameKeyIfExistsAndUnused** | boolean | no | true | If true, rename external key if it exists and is unused |
| **migrated** | boolean | no | false | If true, subscription is migrated |
| **skipResponse**               | boolean | no | false | TODO    
| **callCompletion** | boolean | no | false | see below |
| **callTimeoutSec** | long | no | unlimited? | Timeout in seconds (see below) |
| **pluginProperty** | array of strings | false | omit |list of plugin properties, if any |

Creating a subscription often triggers the creation of an invoice, and associated with this there is often a payment (against the invoice). If **callCompletion** is true, the call to this API will be delayed until the invoice is created and/or the payment is processed. However, the maximum delay in seconds will be given by **callTimeoutSec**.

**Response**

If successful, returns a status code of 201 and an empty body. In addition, a `Location` header is returned which contains URL to fetch the newly created bundles.

### Update the BCD associated with a subscription

This API allows you to change the Bill Cycle Date, BCD, for a given subscription.
This only applies to subscriptions whose recurring term is month based -- e.g `MONTHLY`, `ANNUAL`, ... 

For example if a given subscription was invoiced on the 1st, then one could use this API
to realign invoicing, let's say on the 16th. 

**HTTP Request** 

`PUT http://127.0.0.1:8080/1.0/kb/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/bcd`

```

````javascript
const api: killbill.SubscriptionApi = new killbill.SubscriptionApi(config);

const subscription: Subscription = {billCycleDayLocal: 10};
const subscriptionId = 'e5254822-680f-4720-b5e1-a7146cefb904';

api.updateSubscriptionBCD(subscription, subscriptionId, 'created_by');
````

````php
$apiInstance = $client->getSubscriptionApi();

$xKillbillCreatedBy = "user";
$xKillbillReason = "reason";
$xKillbillComment = "comment";

$body = new Subscription();
$body -> setBillCycleDayLocal(5);

$apiInstance->updateSubscriptionBCD($body, $xKillbillCreatedBy, $subscriptionId, $xKillbillReason, $xKillbillComment,  $effectiveFromDate, $forceNewBcdWithPastEffectiveDate);
````

**Request Body**

The new BCD needs to be specified in the request body via the `billCycleDayLocal` field.

**Query Parameters**

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| ---- | ---- | -------- | ------- |  ----------- |
| **effectiveFromDate** | string | no | immediate | Date on which this change becomes effective in `yyyy-mm-dd` format. | 
| **forceNewBcdWithPastEffectiveDate** | boolean | no | false | See below | 

By default the effective date must be in the future so as to not modify existing invoices. Setting **forceNewBcdWithPastEffectiveDate** to true allows the date to be set in the past. 

Secondly, even after this endpoint is executed, the [Retrieve a Subscription](subscription.html#subscription-retrieve-a-subscription-by-id) endpoint will still return the old BCD until an invoice is generated on the new BCD.


**Response**

If successful, returns a status code of 204 and an empty body.

````

**Request Body**

A subscription resource object specifying either the `planName` or a combination of `productName`, `billingPeriod` and `priceList`. 

**Query Parameters**

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| ---- | ---- | -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| **billingPolicy** | string | no | default | Billing policy that will be used to make this change effective (see below) |
| **requestedDate** | string | no | immediate | Date/DateTime at which this change should become effective in `yyyy-mm-dd`/`yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ`  format.|
| **callCompletion** | boolean | no | false | see below |
| **callTimeoutSec** | long | no | unlimited? | Timeout in seconds (see below) |
| **pluginProperty** | array of strings | false | omit |list of plugin properties, if any |

**billingPolicy**: Possible values are START_OF_TERM, END_OF_TERM, IMMEDIATE, or ILLEGAL

**requestedDate**: This date is only used if no billingPolicy was specified.

Changing the plan associated to a subscription often triggers the creation of an invoice, and associated with this there is often a payment (against the invoice). If **callCompletion** is true, the call to this API will be delayed until the invoice is created and/or the payment is processed. However, the maximum delay in seconds will be given by **callTimeoutSec**.

**Other Notes:**

* When a `DateTime` is specified corresponding to the `requestedDate` parameter, it may or may not include a timezone component. If a timezone is included (like `entitlementDate=2024-03-10T11:00:00-08:00`), the specified timezone (`PST` in this case) is used. If timezone is not included (like `entitlementDate=2024-03-07T11:15`), it defaults to UTC.

**Response**

If successful, returns a status code of 204 and an empty body.


### Undo a pending change plan on a subscription

**Query Parameters**

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| ---- | ---- | -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| **requestedDate** | string | no | immediate | Date/DateTime at which this change should become effective in `yyyy-mm-dd`/`yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ`  format.|
| **entitlementPolicy** | string | no | IMMEDIATE | entitlement policy (see below) |
| **billingPolicy** | string | no | default policy from catalog if present, otherwise `END_OF_TERM` | billing policy (see below) |
| **useRequestedDateForBilling** | boolean | no | false | use **requestedDate** for billing |
| **callCompletion** | boolean | no | false | see below |
| **callTimeoutSec** | long | no | unlimited? | Timeout in seconds (see below) |
| **pluginProperty** | array of strings | false | omit |list of plugin properties, if any |

**entitlementPolicy**: Possible values are IMMEDIATE, END_OF_TERM

**billingPolicy**: Possible values are START_OF_TERM, END_OF_TERM, or IMMEDIATE

Creating a subscription often triggers the creation of an invoice, and associated with this there is often a payment (against the invoice). If **callCompletion** is true, the call to this API will be delayed until the invoice is created and/or the payment is processed. However, the maximum delay in seconds will be given by **callTimeoutSec**.

Since we offer the ability to control the cancelation date for both entitlement (service) and billing either through policies, dates or null values (now), it is important to understand how those parameters work:

* If `entitlementPolicy` has been defined, the `requestedDate` is ignored, and we either default to the catalog defined `billingPolicy` for this `Plan`, or use the one provided in this API.
* If not, the `requestedDate` is used to compute the entitlement cancelation date, and the null value means change should be immediate. The billing date will then be computed the following way:
  * If `billingPolicy` has been specified, it is used to compute the billing cancelation date
  * If `billingPolicy` has not been specified, we either use the `requestedDate` when `useRequestedDateForBilling` is true or default to the catalog defined `billingPolicy` for this `Plan`

So, the common use case would require the following:

* **Immediate cancelation**: This will create a prorated credit unless this aligns with the subscription charged through date (`CTD`), that is, the date up to which it was invoiced, and then from an entitlement point of view it will deactivate service immediately. In order to achieve this result, one can pass the following parameters: `entitlementPolicy`=`IMMEDIATE` and `billingPolicy`=`IMMEDIATE`; alternatively passing no parameters and therefore a null `requestedDate` would produce the same result.
* **EOT cancelation**: This will not create any proration and will keep the service active until the end of the period (`CTD`). In order to achieve this result, one can pass the following parameters: `entitlementPolicy`=`END_OF_TERM` and `billingPolicy`=`END_OF_TERM`.

The reason for all this complexity is to allow to control entitlement and billing date separately, and also avoid users to have to compute dates to achieve certain behavior by relying on well defined policies.

**Other Notes:**

* If a subscription is created with a future date and if the cancel method is invoked for immediate cancellation, the cancellation takes effect only after the subscription creation date is reached. Thus, the subscription remains in `PENDING` state until the subscription creation date is reached after which it is moved to the `CANCELLED` state.
* When a `DateTime` is specified corresponding to the `requestedDate` parameter, it may or may not include a timezone component. If a timezone is included (like `entitlementDate=2024-03-10T11:00:00-08:00`), the specified timezone (`PST` in this case) is used. If timezone is not included (like `entitlementDate=2024-03-07T11:15`), it defaults to UTC.

**Returns**

If successful, returns a status code of 204 and an empty body.

### Retrieve subscription event audit logs with history by subscription event id

Retrieve a list of audit log records showing changes to a subscription event. History information (a copy of the full subscription event object) is included with each record. The [subscription resource](##subscription-subscription-resource) contains the list of events associated with a subscription and the event id can be obtained from here.

Some examples:

* If a cancel request is issued for a subscription, this API can be invoked with the subscription event id of the `CANCEL` event. In this case, it will return:
  * An `INSERT` record corresponding to the subscription cancel event creation
* If a subscription is future cancelled and then uncancelled, and this API is invoked with the id of the `CANCEL`event, it will return two records:
  * An `INSERT` record corresponding to the `CANCEL` event creation
  * A `DELETE` record corresponding to the `CANCEL` event deletion.
