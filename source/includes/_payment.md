# Payment

A Payment in Kill Bill is an amount paid or payable on a specific account due to an invoice or independent of any invoice.

A Payment may be associated with a series of `PaymentTransaction`s, such as authorization, payment attempt, chargeback, etc. each of which may succeed or fail.

A Payment Transaction takes place using a `PaymentMethod` such as a credit card. The transaction is processed by a plugin, which provides access to the appropriate payment gateway. The payment gateway processes the transaction, using the Payment Method provided in the request.

A Payment Attempt is an attempt to perform a Payment Transaction. A Payment Attempt may succeed or fail, and a Payment Transaction may have more than one Payment Attempt. In some cases a Payment Transaction may be in a PENDING state waiting for completion of its processing by the plugin.

Please refer to the [payment manual](http://docs.killbill.io/latest/userguide_payment.html) for more details.

## Payment Resource

A Payment is represented by a `Payment` resource object. The attributes for the Payment resource are as follows:

| Name | Type | Generated by | Description |
| ---- | -----| -------- | ------------ |
| **paymentId** | string | system | UUID for the payment |
| **accountId** | string | system | UUID for the account |
| **paymentNumber** | number | user or system | User's ID number for the payment |
| **paymentExternalKey** | string | user or system | Optional external key |
| **authAmount** | string | system | Total amount authorized (see below) |
| **capturedAmount** | string | system | Total amount captured (see below) |
| **purchasedAmount** | string | system | Total amount purchased (see below) |
| **refundedAmount** | string | system | Total amount refunded (see below) |
| **creditedAmount** | string | system | Total amount credited (see below) |
| **currency** | string | user or system | Currency associated with the account |
| **paymentMethodId** | string | system | UUID for the payment method |
| **transactions** | list | system | **PaymentTransactions** associated with this payment (see below) |
| **paymentAttempts** | list | system | Payment retries (see below) |

* **authAmount**: Total amount that is authorized for this payment. Often this is the amount authorized by a single AUTHORIZATION Payment Transaction.

* **capturedAmount**: Total amount that has been captured (that is, successfully paid).

* **purchasedAmount**: Total amount that has been purchased. A PURCHASE transaction combines authorization and capture.

* **refundedAmount**: Total amount that has been refunded.

* **creditedAmount**: Total amount that has been credited.

* **paymentAttempts**: Number of payment attempts; this is only effective when the system has been configured to retry failed transactions.

The attributes for a `PaymentTransaction` are described [here](payment-transaction.html#payment-transaction-payments-transactions).


## Payments

These endpoints initiate transactions on an existing Payment. To begin a new Payment, see [Trigger a Payment](account.html#account-trigger-a-payment-authorization-purchase-or-credit) in the Account API. 

### Capture an existing authorization [using paymentId]

Attempts to capture a payment amount based on a prior authorization. (A prior authorization may be created via the [Trigger a Payment](account.html#account-trigger-a-payment-authorization-purchase-or-credit) endpoint). The Payment is identified by its `paymentId` provided as a path parameter.

### Combo api to create a new payment transaction on a existing (or not) account

This API creates a PaymentTransaction of type AUTHORIZE, PURCHASE, or CREDIT. This is the same as the API [Trigger a Payment](account.html#account-trigger-a-payment-authorization-purchase-or-credit) described with the Account endpoints. However, this API can optionally create a new Account and register a new PaymentMethod at the same time.

paymentApi.create_combo_payment(body,
                                created_by,

                                api_secret)
```

**Request Body**

The request body is a JSON string that represents three distinct objects: account, paymentMethod, and transaction. For example:

```
{
  "account": {
  },
  "paymentMethod": {
    "pluginName": "__EXTERNAL_PAYMENT__"
  "transaction": {
    "transactionType": "AUTHORIZE",
    "amount": 500,
    "currency": "USD"
  }
}
```

This example assumes that a new Account is to be created.

1. No attributes are required for the account; however if the `currency` attribute is not given here it must be given for the transaction.

2. If a new account is created, a new paymentMethod must be registered for that account.  The only attribute required here is the pluginName.

3. The transaction object contains, as a minimum, the transaction type, the amount, and the currency, unless given with the account.

**Query Parameters**

None. 

**Returns**

If successful, returns a status code of 201 and an empty body. In addition, a `Location` header containing the `paymentId` is returned.


## Custom Fields

Custom fields are `{key, value}` attributes that can be attached to any customer resource. In particular they can be added to Payment objects. For details on Custom Fields see [Custom Field](custom-field.html#custom-field).

### Add custom fields to payment

Adds one or more custom fields to a payment object. Existing custom fields are not modified.
