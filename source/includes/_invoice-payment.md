# Invoice Payment

An `InvoicePayment` is a `Payment` that is made against a specific invoice.

By default the system will always attempt to make a full payment against an invoice, but Kill Bill also allows multiple partial payments.  Partial payments can be made against unpaid - or partially paid - invoices by triggerring a payment against the `Invoice` resource. The reverse is not true; a single payment across multiple invoices is not (yet) supported.

See [Payment](#payment) for further information.

## Invoice Payment Resource

The `InvoicePayment` resource represents a payment associated with a given invoice. It is identical to the `Payment` resource except for the inclusion of the **targetInvoiceId** attribute. 


| Name | Type | Generated by | Description |
| ---- | -----| -------- | ------------ |
| **targetInvoiceId** | string | system | UUID for the invoice to be paid |
| **accountId** | string | system | UUID for the account to be paid |
| **paymentId** | string | system | UUID for the payment |
| **paymentNumber** | number | user | User's ID number for the payment |
| **paymentExternalKey** | string | user | optional external key |
| **authAmonunt** | number | user or system | Total authorized amount (see below) |
| **capturedAmonunt** | number | user or system  | Total captured amount (see below) |
| **purchasedAmonunt** | number | user or system | Total purchased amount (see below) |
| **refundedAmount** | number | user or system | Total refunded amount (see below) |
| **creditedAmount** | number | user or system | Total credited amount (see below) |
| **currency** | string | user | currency to be used |
| **paymentMethod** | string | system | UUID for the payment method used |
| **transactions** | list | system | list of paymentTransactions, if any (see below) |
| **paymentAttempts** | list | system | list of paymentAttempts, if any (see below) |

* **authAmount**, **capturedAmount**, **purchasedAmount**, **refundedAmount**, **creditedAmount**: These are total amounts across all transactions associated with this Payment.

* **creditedAmount**: this credit represents the actual money sent back by the merchant to the user, which is extremely rare. It is unrelated to the associated invoice or account credits.

* **paymentTransactions**: List of transactions for this Payment. The attributes for a `PaymentTransaction` are described [here](https://killbill.github.io/slate/?shell#payment-transaction-payment-transaction-resource).

* **paymentAttempts**: Only applicable when the system is configured to retry failed attempts.


## Invoice Payment Transaction Resource

The `InvoicePaymentTransaction` resource represents a payment transaction associated with a given `InvoicePayment`. It is identical to the `PaymentTransaction` resource except for the inclusion of the **isAdjusted** and **adjustments** attributes. The attributes for this resource object are:

| Name | Type | Generated by | Description |
| ---- | -----| -------- | ------------ |
| **transactionId** | string | system | UUID for the transaction |
| **transactionExternalKey** | string | user or system | Optional external key |
| **paymentId** | string | system | UUID for the transaction |
| **paymentExternalKey** | string | user or system | Optional external key |
| **transactionType** | string | user | Transaction type (see below) |
| **amount** | number | system | Total amount of the transaction |
| **currency** | string | user or system | Currency associated with the account |
| **effectiveDate** | string | user | Effective date of the transaction |
| **processedAmount** | number | system | The amount processed by the gateway (see below) |
| **processedCurrency** | string | system | The currency processed by the gateay (see below) |
| **status** | string | system | Transaction status (see below) |
| **gatewayErrorCode** | string | system | Error code returned by the payment gateway |
| **gatewayErrorMsg** | string | system | Error message returned by the payment gateway |
| **firstPaymentReferenceId** | string | system | Payment gateway reference |
| **secondPaymentReferenceId** | string | system | see below |
| **properties** | string | user | see below |
| **isAdjusted** | boolean | system | true if this object includes one or more InvoiceItem adjustments |
| **adjustments** | list | system | List of adjusted `InvoiceItem` resources showing adjusted amounts |

* **transactionType**: Possible values are: AUTHORIZE, CAPTURE, CHARGEBACK, CREDIT, PURCHASE, REFUND, VOID 

* **processedAmount**: This will often match **amount**, but could be different, perhaps due to currency conversion

* **processedCurrency**: This will often match **currency**, but could be different, perhaps due to currency conversion

* **status**: Possible values are: SUCCESS, UNKNOWN, PENDING, PAYMENT_FAILURE, PLUGIN_FAILURE, or PAYMENT_SYSTEM_OFF

* **secondPaymentReferenceId**: Typically the ID from the actual payment processor, when the gateway is a PSP

* **properties**: Plugin-specific properties to be interpreted by the plugin



## Invoice Payment

These endpoints initiate transactions on an existing InvoicePayment. Many other applicable transactions are given in the [Payment](#payment) section. To begin a new Payment, see [Trigger a Payment](https://killbill.github.io/slate/#account-trigger-a-payment-authorization-purchase-or-credit) in the Account API.

### Record a chargeback

**Query Parameters**
