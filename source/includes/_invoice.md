# Invoice

An invoice is a bill provided to a customer for charges that are payable on the customer's account. A single invoice consolidates charges for all subscriptions held by that customer for a specified time period. Invoices may be set to be paid automatically, or may be paid manually by the customer.

An invoice contains a list of `InvoiceItem`s. The system will always invoice at the `Account` level, and will therefore create as many items on a given
invoice as there are things to invoice. Given an active `Subscription`, one could see multiple items for that subscription on a single invoice including recurring items, usage items, fixed price items, etc. There can also be items for different subscriptions on the same invoice, as well as items that are unrelated to subscriptions such as adjustments and taxes.

An invoice can be generated manually if there are any outstanding charges. In addition, charges can be explicitly added that will also result in an invoice being generated. Invoices can also be automatically generated by the system when there are existing active subscriptions for the `Account`. In the latter case, the `targetDate` will determine up to which point to invoice, and the billing mode (`IN_ADVANCE` or `IN_ARREAR`) will determine which period to charge for.

An invoice can have one of the following status values: DRAFT, COMMITTED, or VOID.

* An invoice in DRAFT status is open to receive additional items, and is not considered by the rest of the system when computing account balances or related values.

* A COMMITTED invoice is immutable, and its balance is reflected at the Account level. Payments can only happen against COMMITTED invoices.

* A VOID invoice is ignored by the rest of the system. A DRAFT or COMMITTED invoice may be voided, but only if there are no successful payments against that invoice. Thus before voiding an invoice, any successful payments need to be refunded.



## Invoice Resource


An `Invoice` resource represents an invoice associated with a specific account. The attributes contained in this resource are the following:

| Name | Type | Generated by | Description |
| ---- | -----| -------- | ------------ |
| **invoiceId** | string | system | UUID for the invoice |
| **accountId** | string | system | UUID for the account |
| **amount** | number | user or system | Sum of all item amounts |
| **currency** | string | user or system | Currency associated with the account |
| **status** | string | system | Status of the invoice: DRAFT, COMMITTED or VOID |
| **creditAdj** | number | system | Invoice credit (amount that we owe to the customer). It is calculated as the sum of `CBA_ADJ` invoice items|
| **refundAdj** | number | system | Refund amount associated with an invoice. It is calculated as the sum of all invoice payment amounts of type `REFUND` and `CHARGED_BACK`. |
| **invoiceDate** | date | system | Date when this invoice was generated |
| **targetDate** | date | user or system | Date up to which the account has been invoiced |
| **invoiceNumber** | number | system | Invoice number |
| **balance** | number | system |  Invoice balance (amount that a customer owes as part of an invoice). At a high level, it is calculated as the sum of all item amounts minus the payment amount. See [Invoice Balance](https://docs.killbill.io/latest/invoice_examples.html#_invoice_balance) for further details. |
| **bundleKeys** | list | system |List of bundles invoiced. Deprecated. |
| **credits** | list | system | List of credits associated with this invoice. Deprecated. |
| **items** | list | system | List of invoice items on this invoice |
| **isParentInvoice** | boolean | system | If true, this invoice is the parent in the hierarchical model |
| **parentInvoiceId** | string | system | In the hierarchical model, UUID of the parent invoice |
| **parentAccountId** | string | system | In the hierarchical model, UUID of the parent account |



## InvoiceItem Resource

An `InvoiceItem` resource represents a single item charged on an invoice. The attributes contained in this resource are the following:

| Name | Type | Generated by | Description |
| ---- | -----| -------- | ------------ |
| **invoiceItemId** | string | system | UUID for the invoice item |
| **invoiceId** | string | system | UUID for the invoice |
| **linkedInvoiceItemId** | string |system | UUID for the linked item, if any (see below) |
| **accountId** | string | system | UUID for the account |
| **childAccountId** | string | system | In the hierarchical model, the UUID of the child account |
| **bundleId** | string | system | UUID for the bundle |
| **subscriptionId** | string | system | UUID for the subscription (present only if invoice item corresponds to a subscription) |
| **planName** | string | system | Name of the `Plan` for this subscription if any|
| **phaseName** | string | system | Name of the `PlanPhase` for this subscription if any|
| **usageName** | string | system | Name of the `Usage` section for this subscription if any|
| **prettyPlanName** | string | system | Pretty name of the `Plan` for this subscription if any|
| **prettyPhaseName** | string | system | Pretty name of the `PlanPhase` for this subscription if any|
| **prettyUsageName** | string | system | Pretty name of the `Usage` section for this subscription if any|
| **itemType** | string | system | Item type (see below) |
| **description** | string | user or system | Optional description of the item |
| **startDate** | date | user or system | Start date of the period invoiced |
| **endDate** | date | user or system | End date of the period invoiced |
| **amount** | number | user or system | Amount being invoiced |
| **quantity** | number | user or system | Rate associated with the `Plan` |
| **currency** | string | user or system | Currency associated with the account |
| **itemDetails** | string | user or system | In usage mode, details about what was invoiced. |
| **childItems** | list | user or system | In the hierarchical model, the items for the children. |

**linkedInvoiceItemId**: This ID is used to link to another item. For example, an item representing an adjustment would link to the item being adjusted.

**itemType**: The following invoice item types are currently supported:

* `EXTERNAL_CHARGE`: Charge independent of any subscription state - typically added using invoice APIs.
* `FIXED`: Fixed (one-time) charge associated with a subscription.
* `RECURRING`: Recurring charge associated with a subscription.
* `REPAIR_ADJ`: Internal adjustment generated by the system, used for billing in advance when the subscription state changed.
* `CBA_ADJ`: Credit (positive or negative) generated by the system.
* `ITEM_ADJ`: Invoice item adjustment -- by itself or triggered by a refund.
* `USAGE`: Usage item
* `TAX`: Tax item -- this can only be added through an invoice plugin
* `PARENT_SUMMARY`: In the hierarchical model, represents the summary across all children

Refer to the [Subscription Billing](https://docs.killbill.io/latest/userguide_subscription.html#components-invoicing) document for further details.  

## InvoiceDryRun Resource

An `InvoiceDryRun` object represents an invoice preview generated to determine what would be in the invoice scheduled on a certain date, or if certain changes are made. A dry run has no actual effect on the system. The attributes contained in this resource are the following:

## Invoice

These endpoints provide basic operations on invoices.

### Trigger an invoice run


Create an invoice run for the associated account. This may result in the creation of a new invoice if there is anything to invoice for, or nothing, if the account is up to date. If an invoice is created, all necessary attributes are determined by the system.

**Request Body**

An invoice item resource object with at least the `amount` attribute. If multiple invoice items are specified, a single invoice is created with all the invoice items. 


**Query Parameters**

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| ---- | -----| -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| **requestedDate** | string | no | current date | requested date |
| **autoCommit** | boolean | no | false | If true, the resulting invoice should be COMMITTED. |

**Response**

If successful, returns a status code of 201 and an invoice item object.


### Create tax items

Normally, tax items are added to an invoice by a plugin, which intercepts the invoice during its creation and adds the required tax items on the fly. However, sometimes you may want to add tax items directly. This API adds a tax item to an account, which will result in the creation of a new invoice. Also, it is worth noting, that the tax items are not linked to any existing `invoiceItem`s. Consequently, specifying fields like `linkedInvoiceItemId`, `subscriptionId` while creating the tax item has no effect. These fields do not get saved on the database and will not be returned in subsequent `GET` requests.

**HTTP Request**

### Void an invoice

Change the status of an invoice to VOID. A void invoice is ignored by the rest of the system. There are some restrictions for this operation:

* We cannot VOID an invoice that was partially or fully paid
* We cannot VOID an invoice if it contains positive credit items (`CBA_ADJ` >0), unless such credit was not used, i.e there is enough credit left on the account.
* We cannot VOID an invoice if it was repaired, i.e there exists a `REPAIR_ADJ` item pointing to an item inside that invoice.

**Request Body**

An invoice item resource object with at least `invoiceItemId`, `invoiceId`, and `amount` attributes. 

**Query Parameters**

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| ---- | -----| -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| **requestedDate** | string | no | current date | requested date |

**Returns**

If successful, returns a status code of 201 and an empty body. In addition, a `Location` header containing the invoice id is returned.


### Delete a CBA item

Delete a Credit Balance Adjust (`CBA_ADJ`) invoice item. There are some limitations and side effects with this api:

1. Deleting a positive `CBA_ADJ` (credit generation), may lead the system to reclaim portion of the used credit, possibly leaving some invoices with a balance. Example:

Given an invoice, I1,  where user added some credit ($12), we would see the following items: {`CREDIT_ADJ`: -12, `CBA_ADJ`: +12}. Given another invoice, I2, where the system invoiced for a recurring subscription, and where some of this credit was consumed, we would see the following items: {`RECURRING`: +10, `CBA_ADJ`: -10}. Deleting the `CBA_ADJ` from I1, would lead to the following resulting invoices:  I1 {`CREDIT_ADJ`: 0, `CBA_ADJ`: 0} and I2 {`RECURRING`: +10, `CBA_ADJ`: 0}. The system zeroed-out the credit generation and the part that was used, and as a result I2 would be left with a balance of +10. Deleting the `CBA_ADJ` from I2 on the other hand would lead to the following invoice:  I2 {`RECURRING`: +20, `CBA_ADJ`: 0} . 

2. System generated credit

In an in-advanced scenario where the system first invoiced for a recurring subscription ($20), and then repaired ($-8) for instance as a result of an early cancelation, we would have the following invoices: I1 {`RECURRING`: +20} and I2 {`REPAIR_ADJ`: -8, `CBA_ADJ`: +8}. Attempting to delete the `CBA_ADJ` on I2 would fail as the generation of credit was system generated, i.e it happened as a result of a subscription change.

## Dry-run

In some situations, it is necessary to preview what a given customer will be invoiced for before making changes, or to verify what the system will generate at a future date. Kill Bill provides a dry-run invoice API to accomplish these goals. This API can be used to answer several distinct questions:

* When is the next upcoming invoice for a given customer, and what will this invoice contain?
* When is the next upcoming invoice associated with a given subscription or bundle, and what will this invoice contain?
* Given a `targetDate`, what invoice will the system generate?
* Given a change in a subscription, such as a new subscription, change of plan, or cancellation, what invoice will the system generate?

A dry run is based on a [dry run resource object](https://killbill.github.io/slate/#invoice-invoicedryrun-resource).


### Generate a dry run invoice

This endpoint creates a dry-run invoice. Based on its parameters you can obtain answers to the different questions listed above.

Note: This endpoint is rather expensive, as it creates a full invoice run for the designated account, but no invoice will be created or persisted
in the system.

**Request Body**

A [dry run resource object](https://killbill.github.io/slate/#invoice-invoicedryrun-resource). The **dryRunType** and sometimes **dryRunAction** must be specified. Other attributes depend on these:

| **dryRunType** | **dryRunAction** | **Other Required Attributes** |**Other Optional Attributes** |**Description**
|--|--|--|--|--|
| TARGET_DATE   |   N/A  |  none |none |Preview the invoice as of the target date specified as a query parameter|
| UPCOMING_INVOICE | N/A | none |subscriptionId or bundleId (When specified, computes the upcoming invoice for the specified subscription/bundle. Note that if there are other subscriptions invoiced on the same day, these will also be included in the upcoming invoice) |Preview the next scheduled invoice. `targetDate` query parameter does not need to be specified, it is ignored even if specified|
| SUBSCRIPTION_ACTION | START_BILLING or CHANGE | subscriptionId, bundleId and  the productName, productCategory, billingPeriod combination or planName |effectiveDate, priceListName, billingPolicy|Preview the invoice that would be generated if the **START_BILLING** or **CHANGE** action is taken|
| SUBSCRIPTION_ACTION | STOP_BILLING | subscriptionId, bundleId|  effectiveDate |Preview the invoice that would be generated if the **STOP_BILLING** action is taken|

**Query Parameters**

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| ---- | -----| -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| **accountId** | string | yes | none | Account id |
| **targetDate** | string | No | current date | Target date is the invoicing target date |
    

Note that for `SUBSCRIPTION_ACTION`, there are 2 dates to take into account:

* The `effectiveDate` in the body specifies when the action (e.g CREATE) takes place
* The `targetDate` as a query parameter specifies the date for the billing, i.e how far in the future we want to bill for. A null `targetDate` default to now.



**Response**

If successful, returns a status code of 200 and an invoice resource object.

## Invoice Groups

An invoice group is a group of invoices. An invoice group plugin can be used to split an invoice into multiple invoices. Such split invoices belong to a single invoice group. 

Note that Kill Bill does not provide any reference implementation for an invoice group plugin. So anyone wishing to use this feature would need to create an invoice plugin and implement the [InvoicePluginApi#getInvoiceGrouping](https://github.com/killbill/killbill-plugin-api/blob/20e10d463b67b0434e1b9f4dd62ed34ebe84bd9b/invoice/src/main/java/org/killbill/billing/invoice/plugin/api/InvoicePluginApi.java#L41) method. We provide a [demo plugin](https://github.com/killbill/killbill-invgrp-demo) that demonstrates how an invoice group plugin can be implemented. When such a plugin is configured, an [invoice group run](https://killbill.github.io/slate/#invoice-trigger-an-invoice-group-run) would result in the generation of multiple invoices.


### Trigger an invoice group run

Triggers an invoice group run for the associated account. This would result in the creation of split invoices only if an invoice group plugin is configured. Otherwise, this endpoint behaves the same way as the [Trigger an invoice run](https://killbill.github.io/slate/#invoice-trigger-an-invoice-run) endpoint.

## Tags

See [Account Tags](https://killbill.github.io/slate/#account-tags) for an introduction.

The only `system` tag applicable for an `Invoice` is `WRITTEN_OFF` (`00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000004`), which as it's name indicates, is used to write off an unpaid invoice, bringing its balance to $0.

## Translation

These endpoints support translation of invoices to a different language when required by the customer. Refer to our [Internationalization manual](https://docs.killbill.io/latest/internationalization.html#_language_translations) for an introduction.

Translation replaces words and phrases in an invoice or catalog with the equivalent words or phrases in a different language. A tenant may upload translation tables for specific locales (e.g., locale `fr_FR` for French). When a customer accesses an invoice, that invoice will be generated from the system data, formatted using the appropriate template (see below), and translated according to the locale of the customer's account, if a translation table exists for that locale.

### Upload the catalog translation for the tenant

Uploads a catalog translation table that will be saved under a specified locale. The translation table gives a translation for specific names in the current catalog.

## Template

A template is a document based on [**mustache**](https://mustache.github.io/) that provides the layout information for invoices. The template will be translated according to the translation table, if any, and the invoice data will be filled in by the Kill Bill system. Refer to our [Internationalization manual](https://docs.killbill.io/latest/internationalization.html#_language_translations) for an introduction.

### Upload the manualPay invoice template for the tenant

Uploads an invoice template based on the manual pay option, for accounts that have the MANUAL_PAY tag. These accounts manually pay their invoices (e.g. ACH). Typically, this template will contain extra information like the company bank account details, PO number, etc.

**Query Parameters**

None.



**Response**

If successful, returns a status code of 201 and the automatic pay template.

## Example

The translation and templating process may seem a little complex. Here is a simple example for the use of a template with translation.

1. To begin, a tenant should upload suitable manual pay and autopay templates reflecting her desired layout for the invoice. If this is not done a default template will be used.

2. Suppose the tenant does business with German customers. She then should upload translation tables, perhaps provided by customers, designated for the German locale (de_DE). Tables are needed for both invoice items and catalog items. The invoice items to be translated are the names of the fields on the template, such as invoiceTitle, invoiceAmount, etc. The catalog items to be translated are the names for actual items such as product name and plan name. There can be translation tables for any number of distinct locales.

Catalog translation example (German):

        gold plan = Goldplan
        sports car = Sportwagen
        
Invoice transaltion example (German):

    invoiceTitle = Rechnung
    invoiceNumber = Rechnungsnumber
    invoiceBalance = Rechnungssaldo
    
3. Each account has a designated locale. When an invoice is retrieved for an account, the appropriate translation tables, if any, are used to translate the invoice.

You can refer to the (Invoice Templates Tutorial)[https://docs.killbill.io/latest/invoice_templates.html] to know more about the how this works.

## List and Search

These endpoints allow you to list all invoices or to search for a specific invoice. Note that these endpoints return shallow objects and thus the value `0` is returned for the `amount`, `creditAdj`, `refundAdj` and `balance` fields. In order to retrieve the actual data for these fields, additional endpoints (like retrieve invoice by id) would need to be invoked. 

### List invoices

Retrieve a list of all invoice records for this tenant.
