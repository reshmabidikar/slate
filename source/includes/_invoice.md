# Invoice

An invoice is a bill provided to a customer for charges that are payable on the customer's account. A single invoice consolidates charges for all subscriptions held by that customer for a specified time period. Invoices may be set to be paid automatically, or may be paid manually by the customer.

An invoice contains a list of `InvoiceItem`s. The system will always invoice at the `Account` level, and will therefore create as many items on a given
invoice as there are things to invoice. Given an active `Subscription`, one could see multiple items for that subscription on a single invoice including recurring items, usage items, fixed price items, etc. There can also be items for different subscriptions on the same invoice, as well as items that are unrelated to subscriptions such as adjustments and taxes.

An invoice can be generated manually if there are any outstanding charges. In addition, charges can be explicitly added that will also result in an invoice being generated. Invoices can also be automatically generated by the system when there are existing active subscriptions for the `Account`. In the latter case, the `targetDate` will determine up to which point to invoice, and the billing mode (`IN_ADVANCE` or `IN_ARREAR`) will determine which period to charge for.

An invoice can have one of the following status values: DRAFT, COMMITTED, or VOID.

* An invoice in DRAFT status is open to receive additional items, and is not considered by the rest of the system when computing account balances or related values.

* A COMMITTED invoice is immutable, and its balance is reflected at the Account level. Payments can only happen against COMMITTED invoices.

* A VOID invoice is ignored by the rest of the system. A DRAFT or COMMITTED invoice may be voided, but only if there are no successful payments against that invoice. Thus before voiding an invoice, any successful payments need to be refunded.



## Invoice Resource


An `Invoice` resource represents an invoice associated with a specific account. The attributes contained in this resource are the following:

## Invoice

These endpoints provide basic operations on invoices.

### Trigger an invoice run


Create an invoice run for the associated account. This may result in the creation of a new invoice if there is anything to invoice for, or nothing, if the account is up to date. If an invoice is created, all necessary attributes are determined by the system.


Also refer to our [subscription manual for more examples](https://docs.killbill.io/latest/userguide_subscription.html#invoicing-dry-run)

### Create tax items

Normally, tax items are added to an invoice by a plugin, which intercepts the invoice during its creation and adds the required tax items on the fly. However, sometimes you may want to add tax items directly. This API adds a tax item to an account, which will result in the creation of a new invoice. Also, it is worth noting, that the tax items are not linked to any existing `invoiceItems`. Consequently, specifying fields like `linkedInvoiceItemId`, `subscriptionId` while creating the tax item has no effect. These fields do not get saved on the database and will not be returned in subsequent `GET` requests.

### Void an invoice

Change the status of an invoice to VOID. A void invoice is ignored by the rest of the system. There are some restrictions for this operation:

* We cannot VOID an invoice that was partially or fully paid
* We cannot VOID an invoice if it contains positive credit items (`CBA_ADJ` >0), unless such credit was not used, i.e there is enough credit left on the account.
* We cannot VOID an invoice if it was repaired, i.e there exists a `REPAIR_ADJ` item pointing to an item inside that invoice.

### Adjust an invoice item

Adjust the amount for an invoice item. The system adds a new invoice item of type `ITEM_ADJ` to the invoice. If the invoice was already paid for, the system also adds another invoice item of type `CBA_ADJ` to adjust the credit amount in the next invoice. See [Invoice Examples](https://docs.killbill.io/latest/invoice_examples#_invoice_item_adjustment) for more information.

**Notes:** The `linkedInvoiceItemId` field of the new invoice item points to the id of the invoice item being adjusted.

**Request Body**

An invoice item resource object with at least `accountId`, `invoiceItemId`, `invoiceId`, and `amount` attributes. 

**Query Parameters**

| ---- | -----| -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| **requestedDate** | string | no | current date | requested date |
| **pluginProperty** | array of strings	 | no | omit | list of plugin properties, if any. Should be in the format `key%3Dvalue` |

**Returns**

If successful, returns a status code of 201 and an empty body. In addition, a `Location` header containing the invoice id is returned.


### Delete a CBA item

Delete a Credit Balance Adjust (`CBA_ADJ`) invoice item. There are some limitations and side effects with this api:

**Deleting a positive `CBA_ADJ` (credit generation), may lead the system to reclaim portion of the used credit, possibly leaving some invoices with a balance.** 

Given an invoice, I1,  where user added some credit ($12), we would see the following items: {`CREDIT_ADJ`: -12, `CBA_ADJ`: +12}. Given another invoice, I2, where the system invoiced for a recurring subscription, and where some of this credit was consumed, we would see the following items: {`RECURRING`: +10, `CBA_ADJ`: -10}. Deleting the `CBA_ADJ` from I1, would lead to the following resulting invoices:  I1 {`CREDIT_ADJ`: 0, `CBA_ADJ`: 0} and I2 {`RECURRING`: +10, `CBA_ADJ`: 0}. The system zeroed-out the credit generation and the part that was used, and as a result I2 would be left with a balance of +10. 

**Deleting a negative `CBA_ADJ` would also leave invoice with a balance.** 

So deleting the `CBA_ADJ` from I2 in the example above would lead to the following invoice:  I2 {`RECURRING`: +10, `CBA_ADJ`: 0} . 

**Attempting to delete system generated credit would fail.**

In an in-advanced scenario where the system first invoiced for a recurring subscription ($20), and then repaired ($-8) for instance as a result of an early cancelation, we would have the following invoices: I1 {`RECURRING`: +20} and I2 {`REPAIR_ADJ`: -8, `CBA_ADJ`: +8}. Attempting to delete the `CBA_ADJ` on I2 would fail as the generation of credit was system generated, i.e. it happened as a result of a subscription change.

## Dry-run

In some situations, it is necessary to preview what a given customer will be invoiced for before making changes, or to verify what the system will generate at a future date. Kill Bill provides a dry-run invoice API to accomplish these goals. This API can be used to answer several distinct questions:

* When is the next upcoming invoice for a given customer, and what will this invoice contain?
* When is the next upcoming invoice associated with a given subscription or bundle, and what will this invoice contain?
* Given a `targetDate`, what invoice will the system generate?
* Given a change in a subscription, such as a new subscription, change of plan, or cancellation, what invoice will the system generate?

A dry run is based on a [dry run resource object](invoice.html#invoice-invoicedryrun-resource).


### Generate a dry run invoice

This endpoint creates a dry-run invoice. Based on its parameters you can obtain answers to the different questions listed above.

Note: This endpoint is rather expensive, as it creates a full invoice run for the designated account, but no invoice will be created or persisted
in the system.

**Request Body**

A [dry run resource object](invoice.html#invoice-invoicedryrun-resource). The **dryRunType** and sometimes **dryRunAction** must be specified. Other attributes depend on these:

| **dryRunType** | **dryRunAction** | **Other Required Attributes** |**Other Optional Attributes** |**Description**
|--|--|--|--|--|
| TARGET_DATE   |   N/A  |  none |none |Preview the invoice as of the target date specified as a query parameter|
| UPCOMING_INVOICE | N/A | none |subscriptionId or bundleId (When specified, computes the upcoming invoice for the specified subscription/bundle. Note that if there are other subscriptions invoiced on the same day, these will also be included in the upcoming invoice) |Preview the next scheduled invoice. `targetDate` query parameter does not need to be specified, it is ignored even if specified|
| SUBSCRIPTION_ACTION | START_BILLING | Either a combination of productName, productCategory, billingPeriod or planName. If the dry run is being generated for an ADDON product, then the bundleId also needs to be specified  |effectiveDate, priceListName, billingPolicy|Preview the invoice that would be generated if the **START_BILLING** action is taken|
| SUBSCRIPTION_ACTION | CHANGE | subscriptionId, bundleId and either a combination of productName, productCategory, billingPeriod or planName |effectiveDate, priceListName, billingPolicy|Preview the invoice that would be generated if the **CHANGE** action is taken|
| SUBSCRIPTION_ACTION | STOP_BILLING | subscriptionId, bundleId, effectiveDate| - |Preview the invoice that would be generated if the **STOP_BILLING** action is taken|

**Query Parameters**

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| ---- | -----| -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| **accountId** | string | yes | none | Account id |
| **targetDate** | string | No | current date | Target date is the invoicing target date |
| **pluginProperty** | array of strings	 | no | omit | list of plugin properties, if any. Should be in the format `key%3Dvalue` |
    

Note that for `SUBSCRIPTION_ACTION`, there are 2 dates to take into account:

* The `effectiveDate` in the body specifies when the action (e.g CREATE) takes place
* The `targetDate` as a query parameter specifies the date for the billing, i.e how far in the future we want to bill for. A null `targetDate` default to now.



**Response**

If successful, returns a status code of 200 and an invoice resource object.

## Invoice Groups

An invoice group is a group of invoices. An invoice group plugin can be used to split an invoice into multiple invoices. Such split invoices belong to a single invoice group. 

Note that Kill Bill does not provide any reference implementation for an invoice group plugin. So anyone wishing to use this feature would need to create an invoice plugin and implement the [InvoicePluginApi#getInvoiceGrouping](https://github.com/killbill/killbill-plugin-api/blob/20e10d463b67b0434e1b9f4dd62ed34ebe84bd9b/invoice/src/main/java/org/killbill/billing/invoice/plugin/api/InvoicePluginApi.java#L41) method. We provide a [demo plugin](https://github.com/killbill/killbill-invgrp-demo) that demonstrates how an invoice group plugin can be implemented. When such a plugin is configured, an [invoice group run](invoice.html#invoice-trigger-an-invoice-group-run) would result in the generation of multiple invoices.


### Trigger an invoice group run

Triggers an invoice group run for the associated account. This would result in the creation of split invoices only if an invoice group plugin is configured. Otherwise, this endpoint behaves the same way as the [Trigger an invoice run](invoice.html#invoice-trigger-an-invoice-run) endpoint.

## Tags

See [Account Tags](account.html#account-tags) for an introduction.

The only `system` tag applicable for an `Invoice` is `WRITTEN_OFF` (`00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000004`), which as it's name indicates, is used to write off an unpaid invoice, bringing its balance to $0.

### Add tags to invoice

This API adds one or more tags to an invoice. The tag definitions must already exist.

## Translation

These endpoints support translation of invoices to a different language when required by the customer. Translation replaces words and phrases in an invoice or catalog with the equivalent words or phrases in a different language. A tenant may upload translation tables for specific locales (e.g., locale `fr_FR` for French). When a customer accesses an invoice, that invoice is generated from the system data, formatted using the appropriate [template](invoice.html#template), and translated according to the locale of the customer's account, if a translation table exists for that locale.

Refer to the [Invoice templates document](https://docs.killbill.io/latest/invoice_templates) and
[Internationalization manual](https://docs.killbill.io/latest/internationalization.html#_language_translations) for an introduction to the translation process/Kill Bill's internationalization support.

### Upload the catalog translation for the tenant

Uploads a catalog translation table that will be saved under a specified locale. The translation table provides a translation for specific names in the current catalog that may appear on an invoice (for example, plan names, product names, etc.).

## Template

A template is a document based on [**mustache**](https://mustache.github.io/) that provides the layout information for invoices. When a customer accesses an invoice, the invoice is generated from the system data, formatted using the appropriate template, and translated according to the [invoice translations](invoice.html#translation) corresponding to the locale of the customer's account if any.

Refer to the [Invoice templates document](https://docs.killbill.io/latest/invoice_templates) and
[Internationalization manual](https://docs.killbill.io/latest/internationalization.html#_language_translations) for an introduction to the translation process/Kill Bill's internationalization support.

**Query Parameters**

None.

**Response**

If successful, returns a status code of 201 and the automatic pay template.

## Example

The translation and templating process may seem a little complex. Here is a simple example for the use of a template with translation.

1. To begin, a tenant should upload suitable manual pay and autopay templates reflecting her desired layout for the invoice. If this is not done a default template will be used.

2. Suppose the tenant does business with German customers. She then should upload translation tables, perhaps provided by customers, designated for the German locale (de_DE). Tables are needed for both invoice items and catalog items. The invoice items to be translated are the names of the fields on the template, such as invoiceTitle, invoiceAmount, etc. The catalog items to be translated are the names for actual items such as product name and plan name. There can be translation tables for any number of distinct locales.

 Catalog translation example (German):

        gold plan = Goldplan
        sports car = Sportwagen
        
  Invoice translation example (German):

    invoiceTitle = Rechnung
    invoiceNumber = Rechnungsnumber
    invoiceBalance = Rechnungssaldo
    
3. Each account has a designated locale. When an invoice is retrieved for an account, the invoice is generated using the invoice template and the appropriate translation tables, if any.

## List and Search

These endpoints allow you to list all invoices or to search for a specific invoice. Note that these endpoints return shallow objects and thus the value `0` is returned for the `amount`, `creditAdj`, `refundAdj` and `balance` fields. In order to retrieve the actual data for these fields, additional endpoints (like retrieve invoice by id) would need to be invoked. 

### List invoices

Retrieve a list of all invoice records for this tenant.

### Search invoices

Search for an invoice by a specified search string. If the search string is a number, it is compared to the `invoiceNumber` attribute. An exact match is required.
